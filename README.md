# 2D-Steady-State-Diffusion-Solver-using-Finite-Difference-Methods
This project solves the 2D steady-state diffusion equation using finite difference methods. Implemented from scratch in Python, it compares Gaussian Elimination, Gaussâ€“Seidel, Line-by-Line (TDMA), and ADI methods for accuracy, convergence, and runtime, with contour plots and performance analysis.
